:checkered_flag: picoCTF{l0g1ns_ar3nt_r34l_aaaaa17a}

## Solve
I made a website so now you can log on to! I don't seem to have the admin password. See if you can't get to the flag. `http://2018shell.picoctf.com:5477` ([link](http://2018shell.picoctf.com:5477/))

## Hints
Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for admins? How does check the admin's password?
